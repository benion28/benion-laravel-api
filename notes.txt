To avoid this issue in the future, you can address it in the following ways:

    Enable the zip PHP Extension:
        Open your php.ini file located at C:\xampp\php\php.ini.
        Search for the line ;extension=zip.
        Remove the semicolon (;) at the beginning of the line to uncomment it.
        Save the file and restart your Apache server.

    Install unzip or 7z:
        If you're on Windows, you can install 7-Zip and add its installation directory to your system's PATH variable.
        For unzip, you would need to download and install the appropriate package for your system, but it's generally more common to use 7-Zip on Windows.

    Continue with Source Download:
        If the fallback to source download is working, you can continue the installation process as-is. The project will still be set up correctly, but the installation might take a bit longer.
